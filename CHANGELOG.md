# Changelog

The app's history starts here. It began as a fork of
[MadsLorentzen/ai-job-search](https://github.com/MadsLorentzen/ai-job-search) at v1.7.0; that
project's history is archived, unmaintained, in [CHANGELOG-upstream.md](CHANGELOG-upstream.md).
Version numbers here are this app's own and do not track upstream's.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). An entry says what
changed and, where it matters, the failure that caused the change, because that is the part a
future session needs. `tools/sync_app.py` prints the lines a sync brings in, so write each one to
make sense to somebody whose repo just received it.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`START_HERE.md`**, the five steps from this page to a working search, in plain words:
  make a private copy with "Use this template", let Claude see it, set up the cloud
  environment (the setup line and the job-board domains), say "set me up", and use it.
  Linked from the top of the README.

### Changed

- **`/setup` writes `profile/` and nothing else.** It refuses the app itself and any public
  repo before a word is written, asks the person only plain questions about themselves,
  researches their market (boards, employer ATS, eligibility wording, pay, document
  conventions, place names) and writes every profile file in the shape of
  `profile.example/`, plus empty state files. It used to edit the app's own skill files,
  CLAUDE.md and the example CV, which the next sync would undo.
- **`/reset` has a `state` scope** and removes `profile/` whole rather than blanking files.
  It never deletes the app's templates and fonts.
- SECURITY.md, SETUP.md and the README describe the app as public and a person's copy as
  private.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-10-14

The first release as a template: one app, any number of people, each in their own private repo.

### Added

- **Everything about a person lives in `profile/`.** Identity, history, bullets, skills, market,
  preferences and voice, read by every tool through `tools/person.py`. No tool names a person, an
  employer, a city or a currency of its own; a repo with no `profile/` starts with `/setup`.
- **`tools/personal_paths.py`, the one list of what belongs to a person**: the profile and the
  search's state (tracker, contact book, threads, documents, research). Everything else is the
  app's.
- **An example person, `profile.example/`.** Fictional, complete, and what the app's own tests run
  against, so the suite gives the same answer in the app and in a person's repo. A person's own
  tests live in `profile/tests/` and run in a separate process.
- **`tools/sync_app.py`.** A person's repo pulls the app's updates and never sends anything back.
  The first sync of a template-made repo merges unrelated histories; an app-owned file edited in a
  person's repo is put back and named; personal paths are never touched; `--check` reports how far
  behind and any drift.
- **`tools/build_app.py` and `tools/leak_scan.py`.** The app is built from a person's repo by
  removing every personal path, then scanned for anything of theirs that is left: contact details
  by shape, and every name and fact the person's own data holds, in every form it is written in.
  `tools/ci_local.sh` runs it on every check in a person's repo, and the app's CI runs it on every
  push.

### Changed

- **Private repos spend no Actions minutes by default.** Every CI job runs on a public repo or a
  manual dispatch; `./tools/ci_local.sh` runs the same checks locally, Python 3.10 leg included.
